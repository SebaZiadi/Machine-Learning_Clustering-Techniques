# Machine Learning Clustering Techniques 

# Project description 
Most of the traditional clustering techniques, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, can be used to group 
data without supervision. In this project, we will implement two clustering algorithms from scratch and try it on 
a customized dataset. Finally, we will check the quality of each clustering using external index to compare 
between algorithms. 

# Tasks
1- Implement K-Mean algorithm from scratch and your second choice of clustering 
algorithm (Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, or GMM) from scratch. 
b. use any ready machine learning package to 
apply all three rest algorithms (Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and GMM).   

2- Generate dataset1.  
3- Apply created models on dataset1 and compare the results.  
4- Generate dataset2.  
5- Apply created models on dataset1 and compare the results. 

6- Generate dataset3.  
7- Apply created models on dataset2 and compare the results.  
8- Generate dataset4.  
9- Apply created models on dataset3 and compare the results.  
10- Show the accuracy of each model using the following index:  
a. F-measures 

11- 
b. Normalized mutual information.  
c. Rand Statistic 
Summarize the measures values for all algorithms and compare the results (use 
also visualization).
